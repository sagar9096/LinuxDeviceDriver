1. Registering the platform driver API/macro
	
	platform_driver_register(drv) // uses this macro to register platform driver to the linux platform

2. Platform driver structure .. struct platform_driver
	It has some function pointer like probe,remove,shutdown,suspend,resume. It has device_driver structure as member element

3. Platform device strcure register API
	int platform_device_register(struct *platform_device)
		
4. Platform device structure .. struct platform_device 

5. How do you make when new platform device is attached and exactly the same device driver get auto loaded?
	Platform bus(Linux platform core) manage the device list and driver list. when new device is attached matching is happened and probe function of corrosponding driver is get called. 
	
6. When platform_device module get loaded then "name matching" is done. If the name matched then, "probe" function of platform_driver gets called. When the platform_device is removed remove function of platform_driver gets called.
